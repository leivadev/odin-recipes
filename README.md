# odin-recipes

Â¡Hello! This is my first HTML project learning with TOP (the odin project), currently my goal is to apply all my knowledge about basic elements and atributes of HTML.

This project is about a basic recipe website, and my page will be about 3 recipes from my country **Panama**:

- ropa vieja (a shredded beef).
- arroz con pollo (yellow rice combined with chicken and vegetables.
- hojaldras (a fry-food dough).
