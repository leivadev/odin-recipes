# odin-recipes
¡Hello there! This is my first HTML project learning with TOP (the odin project), currently my goal is to apply all my knowledge about basic elements and atributes of HTML.
This project is about a basic recipe website, and my page will be about 3 recipes from my country Panama, ropa vieja (a shredded beef), arroz con pollo (yellow rice combined with chicken and vegetables and hojaldras (a fry-food dough).
Later on i will update this README with the things i applied to the website.
6/26/2022: I've just finished mt first website! i applied knowledge like images, italic, bold, unordered and ordered lists, titles and subtitles.
